# JDBC Connection Learning üöÄ

This repository demonstrates how to use **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**  
to connect Java programs with databases and perform **CRUD** operations:  
**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repo is divided into two packages for learning flexibility:

- **`individual_ops/`** ‚Üí Each database operation is implemented in a separate file.  
  (Good for beginners to understand each operation step by step.)

- **`crud_all_in_one/`** ‚Üí All CRUD operations are handled in a single file.  
  (Good for practicing a real-world style monolithic approach.)

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Setup and manage a **JDBC connection** from Java.  
- Execute SQL queries directly from Java code.  
- Practice **two approaches**: modular (separate files) & monolithic (all-in-one).  
- Learn **best practices** such as using `PreparedStatement` for SQL execution to avoid SQL injection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Java JDK (‚â• 8 or higher recommended)  
- Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle / etc.)  
- JDBC Driver for your chosen database  
- IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code)
