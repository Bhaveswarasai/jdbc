#JDBC Connection Learning

This repository demonstrates how to use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) 
to connect Java programs with databases
and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
It is divided into two packages for learning flexibility

<**individual_ops**> → Each database operation is implemented in a separate file.

<**crud_all_in_one**> → All CRUD operations are handled in a single file.

##Features

-Setup and manage a JDBC connection.

-Execute SQL queries directly from Java code.

-Work with both modular (separate files) and monolithic (all-in-one) styles of CRUD operations.

-Learn best practices like using PreparedStatements for SQL execution.
